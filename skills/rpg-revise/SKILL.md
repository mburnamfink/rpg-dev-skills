name: rpg-revise
description: Fold a human-answered rpg-critic critique log back into the adventure module it critiques — walk findings in order, apply the fixes the author accepted, ask when a response is ambiguous or design-level, and keep setting/rules canon by grepping the reference files. Use when the author has replied inline to a critique and wants the changes applied to the module, or mentions revising/resolving a critique, applying critic findings, or "action the critique"; NOT for producing the critique (rpg-critic) or first-draft authoring (rpg-dev).

# RPG Revise — Apply a Critique Back to the Module

Close the loop between [rpg-critic](../rpg-critic/SKILL.md) and [rpg-dev](../rpg-dev/SKILL.md).
The critique file is a **dialogue log**: rpg-critic wrote stable-ID findings, the author replied
on the `→ Response:` lines. Your job is to turn those replies into concrete edits in the module,
one finding at a time, without breaking canon.

The author's response is the authority, not the critic's proposed fix. A response may *accept*,
*reject*, *redirect* ("the fix is X instead"), or just *nudge* ("maybe Concord lets her up") —
read intent, don't pattern-match keywords. `→ Status:` is usually blank; that's normal.

## Workflow

1. **Gather inputs.** The critique file (`*-critique*.md`). Read its metadata header to find the
   **module** it critiques and the **reference files** (setting/lore, campaign notes, system rules)
   it was checked against. Confirm the module path with the author before editing anything.
2. **Read the whole module and the whole critique first.** Parse every finding into ID, severity,
   the critic's point + proposed fix, the author's Response, and Status. Build the work list.
3. **Do the Z section first.** Section Z is author→LLM directives (rename an entity, drop an NPC,
   weave in a theme). These ripple across the whole module, so applying them first means every
   later edit already uses the new names/structure. Then work A→G in file order.
4. **For each finding, classify the response** (see below) and act. Grep before you edit.
5. **Record the resolution** on that finding's `→ Status:` line as you go — never silently.
6. **Report** at the end: what was applied, what still needs the author, what was skipped.

## Classifying each response

- **Clear directive** (accept, or "do X instead") → apply it. Don't ask; just do it and record.
- **Nudge / "maybe" / open question / poses a question back** → this needs a design decision.
  Use **AskUserQuestion** with 2–4 concrete options for the edit you'd make (the author picks or
  uses "Other" to steer). Write only after they choose. Item by item.
- **Rejected / deferred** → leave the module untouched; mark Status and move on.
- **No response at all** → ask whether to apply the critic's proposed fix as-is, or skip. Don't
  invent an answer for a finding the author hasn't weighed in on.

Batch only *tightly related* questions (e.g. Z4 drops an NPC and B2 is about that NPC). Otherwise
keep it one finding at a time, as instructed.

## Keep the module coherent — grep, don't guess

Every edit lives inside a larger document; a local fix can contradict something three scenes away
or a fact in the lore.

- **Before editing**, grep the module for the entity the finding touches (NPC, location, rule,
  clock) to find *every* place it appears — a rename or a drop must hit all of them, not just the
  scene the finding cites.
- **When a fix asserts a fact about the world** (a name, a faction, a rule, a timeline), grep the
  **reference files** to confirm the module now agrees with canon. Bend the module, not the setting,
  unless the author says otherwise. Cite the reference file + section in your Status note.
- **When a fix changes a number or a rule** (pool size, a clock, an ability), grep the module for
  the other places that number/rule is stated and reconcile them so the game stays internally
  consistent — the kind of contradiction rpg-critic flags in section A.
- Preserve the module's voice and [TEMPLATE.md](../rpg-dev/TEMPLATE.md) structure. Write direct
  prose and concrete examples into the file, matching rpg-dev's terse, table-ready style.

## Recording resolutions

After acting on a finding, fill its `→ Status:` line in the critique file so the log stays a
durable record of what happened. Revision is iterative — a re-run of rpg-critic on the revised
module reads these Status lines to see what was already addressed, so mark every finding:

- `accepted — applied: {one line on the edit + where}` — done in the module.
- `redirected — applied: {what you did per the author's alternative}`
- `discuss — {the open question}` — waiting on the author; leave the module unchanged.
- `rejected` / `deferred` — per the author; module unchanged.

Leave `→ Response:` lines untouched — they're the author's. Don't delete findings; the file is the
record. When new work surfaces mid-revision, add it to the module's **Open Threads**, not here.

## Stance

- The author's reply wins over the critic's proposed fix, and over your own read.
- A design nudge is an invitation to propose a concrete edit, not license to improvise the module.
- Never apply a 🔴 structural fix and a contradicting one elsewhere — reconcile numbers and names
  across the whole file, then record where.
